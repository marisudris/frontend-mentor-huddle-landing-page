## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned and recapped the `clamp()` function for elements that only require a `font-size` change or `width`/`height` change (like social link buttons) on different viewport sizes.

### Continued development

I want repeat and develop a better intuition from `grid` layouts in general.
